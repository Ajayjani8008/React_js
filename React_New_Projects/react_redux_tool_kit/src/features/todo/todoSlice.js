// Step 2 , create slice  (slice is just a piece (or partition) of your overall application state, along with the logic to handle that piece.)

// It makes Redux more modular, clean, and easier to manage.

export const { addTodo, removeTodo, updateTodo } = todoSlice.actions // You do for individual action, These are action creators â€” functions you use to dispatch actions in your app: ðŸŸ© Purpose: You use them in your components or middleware to tell Redux to do something.

export default todoSlice.reducer  // we do for store confrigration
// ðŸŸ© Purpose: It tells Redux how to update the state when actions are dispatched.

/* Summeriztion : 
Redux calls your reducer function like reducer(currentState, actionObject)

state = current value from the store for this slice

action = the full action object { type, payload }

Redux Toolkit handles a lot of this wiring automatically so you write less boilerplate.
